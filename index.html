    <p class="content">You made it to nasty nineteen! I hope you are having a good year, I have never seen you grow so much in a year like I did this year. 
      You have truly gotten out of your comfort zone and explored a bit (got drunk, did weed before me :(, kissed someone, and lied to the parentals). Well you weren’t 
      always successful in lying, but you know I am sure these will be funny stories you can tell Uncle Sundar in the future. Let’s hope you don't get into more trouble. 
      I am glad we rekindled our friendship in freshman year and ended strong. I always say this, but it is crazy how we have known each other through elementary, middle, and
       high school. Let’s see what our future holds and you for sure won’t be going back to India to find your husband because I am finding one for you here way before. Even though 
       I bully you a lot, you musteth knoweth I loveth your rate self a lot. There's a lot that happened this year and I found it relieving to tell you (and you only) and I hope this
        conveys how important you are to me. Happy birthday Nikhila.</p>
    <p class="ending">Yours,
      <br> Nammu</p>
