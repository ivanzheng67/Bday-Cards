Last Christmas, I gave you my heart… It's been so long since I sang my lungs out to that song. Anyways, Happy Birthday Khushi! Even though I haven’t hung out much this year, 
the moments we do hangout - driving, meeting at the dining hall - are the best. But please this be a warning: we musteth hang out more this year. Oh, we absolutely have to go to 
Mr.H’s wedding and I really hoep you are going to text him on July 1st, either that or I am stalking his house location and we are driving there. Apart from the silliness, you have 
grown so much this year and I hope I didn’t scare you with my breakdowns lol. Just know I am always here too because it seems like you want to vent out your heart (trust me I can 
sympathize despite living in a matriarchy). During the semester you seemed to pour yourself in extracirrculars and academics a lot this year. It is so nice to see a determined and 
hardworking person. Despite this, you need to let loose this summer (and fall) and go to clubs and parties. Happy birthday Khushitha <3
